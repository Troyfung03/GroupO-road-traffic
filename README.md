# Project description:
Topic 2: Hong Kong Road Traffic Analysis
Hong Kong is a densely populated city with a high number of vehicles. The road traffic in Hong
Kong is a complex system with a large number of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. The road
traffic system is also affected by various factors such as weather, time of the day, and road
conditions. In this project, you are expected to analyze the road traffic data in Hong Kong to gain
insights into the road traffic system. The suggested data sources are from data.gov.hk.
Objective
This project is designed for students to apply what they have learned in the lectures and lab sessions
to real-world data for exploratory data analysis and visualization. In particular, students are
expected to identify meaningful data analysis tasks, acquire the relevant datasets, select the
machine learning algorithms for the analysis, evaluate the performance, and present the findings
and insights gained using appropriate visualization methods.
Project Details
You are expected to form groups (4-5 students) to work on the project. The project should include
the following steps:
1. Identify the data analysis tasks
• You are expected to identify 4-5 data analysis tasks; each team member should be assigned
an independent task. While you are free to identify the tasks of your own choice, the
following two are provided for your reference. In general, the more diverse the four tasks
are, the higher marks will be gained. Also, if the 4-5 diverse tasks together can further tell
a coherent story, even better with a higher mark!
Example 1 (Regression): Given the road traffic data of a road for a period of time, predict
the traffic volume for the next week or traffic volume at the same period of time in
another road.
Example 2 (Clustering): Group the roads with a similar pattern of traffic volume in
different time periods or different regions.
2. Identify the data sources relevant to the tasks
• For Example, you could combine the road traffic data from different roads and the weather
data to study the relationship between the traffic volume and the weather. Weather data can
be retrieved from the Hong Kong Observatory on data.gov.hk.
3. Conduct simple data analysis and visualization
• Tabulate and plot the acquired data and their statistics to gain better understanding of the data
for your four tasks (e.g., plot of traffic volume over time, traffic volume per road, etc.). You
are encouraged to use different visualization methods to present the data and the results of
analysis.
4. Apply machine learning algorithms for the analysis
• Apply appropriate machine learning (classification, regression, clustering) algorithms to the
acquired data and visualize the results. If the number of features is large, dimension reduction
techniques (e.g., PCA) can be adopted before applying the machine learning algorithms.
5. Discussion
• Discuss the limitations of the studies and suggest ways to address the limitations as future
work
